Interactive Python Gamification Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors, Geography Quiz, and Betting Engine
Collaborated in a team effort to create an interactive Python text-based game that seamlessly combines geography, trivia, and strategic gaming. Users select countries for gambling, with values assigned based on each country's surface area for fairness. Unlock countries by answering trivia questions correctly. Consecutive losses provide a strategic advantage in Rock-Paper Scissors, enhancing critical thinking and adaptability.
